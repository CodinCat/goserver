# goserver

A minimum web server that serves your static files.

```
go get github.com/CodinCat/goserver
```

restart your terminal, then you can start to use the web server:

```
cd my/web/project
goserver
```
It will listen on 8080 port by default. Or you can specify a port:
```
goserver --port :7777
```

don't forget the colon `:`

that's all!
